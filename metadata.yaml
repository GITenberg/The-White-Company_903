description: "The White Company is a historical adventure by Arthur Conan Doyle set\
  \ during the Hundred Years' War. The story is set in England, France, and Spain,\
  \ in the years 1366 and 1367, against the background of the campaign of Edward,\
  \ the Black Prince to restore Peter of Castile to the throne of the Kingdom of Castile.\
  \ The climax of the book occurs before the Battle of NÃ¡jera. Doyle became inspired\
  \ to write the novel after attending a lecture on the Middle Ages in 1889. After\
  \ extensive research, The White Company was published in serialized form in 1891\
  \ in Cornhill Magazine. Additionally, the book is considered a companion to Doyle's\
  \ later work Sir Nigel, which explores the early campaigns of Sir Nigel Loring and\
  \ Samkin Aylward.\nThe novel is relatively unknown today, though it was very popular\
  \ up through the Second World War. In fact, Doyle himself regarded this and his\
  \ other historical novels more highly than the Sherlock Holmes adventures for which\
  \ he is mainly remembered.\nThe \"White Company\" of the title is a free company\
  \ of archers, led by one of the main characters. The name is taken from a real-life\
  \ 14th-Century Italian mercenary company, led by John Hawkwood.\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
